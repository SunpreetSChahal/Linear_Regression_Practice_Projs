## ML Model Practice

### General Tips:
#### Logistic regression vs. Decision tree:
  - If your data can be split into two seperable parts - use Logistic regression, else, use a Decision tree.

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement learning:
  - Supervised: Uses labelled data to train ML models; takes labelled inputs and maps the result to a known output. You know what the target is.
    - For example, giving the model a picture of a gazelle and seeing what class the model places the image in. 
    - Does require human intervention.

  - Unsupervised: Uses unlabelled data to train ML models; finds trends and patterns found within the input data. The model tries to label the data based on the provided features. The output is unknown.
    - For example, giving the model a picture of a vehicle and seeing what class the model places the image in (car, bus or truck); by seeing the dimensions of the vehicle, features of the vehicle etc.
    - Doesn't require human intervention.
