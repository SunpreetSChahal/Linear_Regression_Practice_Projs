### Linear Regression Practice
--------------------------------
In efforts to develop competancy with regression models - I will be working on various projects to build my ability to apply regression models in a range of topics.

Currently (13/01/21), I'm using train/test splits to _train_ and _test_ my models (4.1 - 4.3). 

I want to branch into using K-Fold cross validation, to make my _more_ accurate.
